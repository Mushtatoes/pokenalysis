# Pokemon - Defense to Weight/Height Correlation

Description: Is there a correlation between a Pokemon's Defense stat and it's height or weight?

Defense is one of the primary stats used during combat in Pokemon. It is one of the fundamental values used in the core combative gameplay of Pokemon.

Weight and Height are go more or less unnoticed in Pokemon games. They're mostly fun facts that exist in the Pokedex. It's highly unlikely that developers look at Defense and Weight/Height in parallel when creating Pokemon.

There are Pokemon like Onix and Steelix, both of which have positively correlated Defense and Weight or Height, but then there are Pokemon like Shuckle...a tiny and light Pokemon with even higher Defense than the two mentioned.

This study will calculate the correlation coefficient between Defense and Weight and determine if these properties have any relationship with each other.
